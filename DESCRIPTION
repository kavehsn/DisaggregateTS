Description: Provides tools for temporal disaggregation, including:
    (1) High-dimensional and low-dimensional series generation for simulation studies;
    (2) A toolkit for temporal disaggregation and benchmarking using low-dimensional indicator series 
        as proposed by Dagum and Cholette (2006, ISBN:978-0-387-35439-2);
    (3) Novel techniques by Mosley, Gibberd, and Eckley (2022, <doi:10.1111/rssa.12952>)
        for disaggregating low-frequency series in the presence of high-dimensional indicator matrices.
